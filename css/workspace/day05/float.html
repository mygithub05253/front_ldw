            Price increases are slowing in pace because of the waning of supply chain issues since China lifted its Covid-19 restrictions in late 2022.
            However, grocery prices are continuing to rise as retailers pass on higher costs to consumers.
            “We expect inflation to continue to decelerate in 2024, as the lagged impact of interest-rate rises starts affecting economic activity, and in turn, consumer demand,” Upasana Dutt, Head of Worldwide Cost of Living at EIU, said in a statement.
            Dutt went on to warn the upside risks of armed conflict and extreme weather remain.
            “Further escalations of the Israel-Hamas war would drive up energy prices, while a greater than expected impact from El Niño would push up food prices even further,” she added.
            Inevitably, increasing living costs have meant that many cities have become more expensive to live in – but some get hit harder than others.
            Further down the list, Russian cities Moscow and St. Petersburg saw some of the sharpest drops, falling 105 places to 142 and 74 places to 147 respectively in this year’s ranking. The value of the ruble has dropped considerably since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
            The survey said the slow post-pandemic recovery and “subdued consumer demand” were among the factors that led to Chinese cities such as Beijing, which ranked at 34 last year, dropping several places down the list.
            Damascus, Syria, remains the world’s cheapest city. Tehran, Iran, and Tripoli, Libya, are also near the bottom, ranking in 172nd and 171st place respectively.
            Utility, domestic help and tobacco costs were highest in US cities, while Western European cities were some of the most expensive when it came to recreation, transport and household goods.
            Groceries and alcohol were most costly in Asian cities, according to the survey.
            The 2023 Worldwide Cost of Living surveyed 173 major cities, comparing more than 400 individual prices across 200 products and services. It excluded Venezuela’s Caracas, where prices have risen by 450% since 2022.
